# Broken Windows

At the macro-level [Wilson & Kelling (1982)](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/03/broken-windows/304465/) describe communities as a non-recursive system where...

.pull-right-40[
* A: Disorder signals low guardianship which increases offending

## Keizer, Lindenberg, & Steg (2008)

Keizer et al. used multiple disorder manipulations and recorded norm violation with field experiments in Groningen, the Netherlands to test micro-level direct effects implied by broken windows.

# Collective Efficacy

[Sampson & Raudenbush (1999)](https://doi.org/10.1086/210356) describe communities as a recursive system where disorder and crime are the result of low collective efficacy, i.e., social control capacity.

.pull-right-40[
* A: Disorder has no direct impact on crime

* C, D: Disorder and crime are products of low collective efficacy

## The Experiments

Over 2000 person-hours of **field experiments**, conducted over four years, embedded in representative Seattle neighbourhoods with rich **ecological survey data** (2002-2003 SNCS), e.g., collective efficacy 

* Balance experimental and observational strengths and weaknesses

* Maximize internal and external validity

* Effect of disorder on crime and prosocial behavior (replicate Keizer)
* Association between collective efficacy and crime and prosocial behavior

* Effect of disorder on sanctioning behavior
* Association between collective efficacy and sanctioning behavior

## Littering Intervention: Method

A confederate walks down the street and flagrantly litters in view of passersby near a trash can with a no-littering sign.<sup>1</sup>

.footnote[[1] Or perhaps hits their dog with garbage.
]

--

Record if...

* Participant decides to **sanction**—risky prosocial behavior
* Participant decides to **throw litter away**—low-risk prosocial behavior

--

Litter and a sign board with graffiti are introduced to **manipulate disorder**.

--

Confederate varied to **manipulate interpersonal context**:
   * Black Man
   * White Man
   * White Woman

--

Full factorial design: 576 trials in 12 census tracts

We also evaluated if our interventions impacted throwing away the dropped litter—a low risk, non-confrontational prosocial action.

# Summary

---

# Experimental Results

Across all experiments, we found...

.pull-left[
![](img/synthesis.svg)
]

.pull-right[
* No disorder effect on theft, a risky behavior (A).

* Disorder attenuates low-risk prosocial actions—mailing letters, throwing away litter (B).

* Collective efficacy predicts some low-risk prosocial action (H,K), but not sanctioning (high risk).

* Risky prosocial behavior is mainly sensitive to interpersonal context (I).
]

---

# Prosocial Decision Making

*We know relatively little about behavioral micro-mechanisms of community theories of crime, particularly sanctioning.*


Contexts of prosocial behavior are important but neglected considerations for community theories of crime.

--

   * Collective efficacy is associated with risk factors—such as retaliation from the sanctioned—as well as criminal opportunities (Lanfear 2022).

???

Perceived likelihood of retaliation may be low in high CE areas, and objective opportunities may also be lower.

--

   * Disorder may be a signal for risks or other costs.

???

Broken windows highlights this---that disorder serves as a signal. What it signals appears to be more complex than BW as investigated by Innes (2004).

--

   * Disorder may signal that interventions will have limited benefit.

???

Little effort required to clean up a single piece of litter, but what difference does picking it up make if there's tons on the ground?

--

   * Context may cause general prosocial intentions to differ from behavior (see [St. Jean 2007](https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/P/bo5298963.html)).

# Lost Letter: Method

Replication of [Milgram et al. (1965)](https://doi.org/10.1086/267344) and [Sampson (2012)](https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo5514383.html).

--

2,938 letters were dropped on Seattle sidewalks for passersby to encounter.<sup>1</sup>

.footnote[[1] Drops conducted on foot in center city and by car in most tracts—at the cost of one car accident. ]

--

24 letters—8 per addressee—were dropped in each census tract:
  * Charles F. Landers Sr. (Personal)
  * Friends of Black Lives Matter (BLM)
  * American Neo-Nazi Party (Nazi)

--

Mailed letters were received at a PO Box monitored by the research team.

???

We still have every single returned letter in storage.

--

Letters were geocoded to drop locations and featured a small printed ID number for tracking.

* The experiment was abandoned after a small number of trials.

* In Ravenna, residents reported the magazine racks on Nextdoor as an "eyesore".

???

Ravenna, where I was living at the time, is a high collective efficacy, fairly affluent, residential neighborhood.

--

* Two magazine racks had locks cut and were removed.

--

* Thus we were unable to continue experiment *because of collective efficacy* in an affluent neighborhood.

--

* In contrast, one rack was left *for an entire year* in Capitol Hill without issue.

# Litter Clean-Up: Alternative

We supposed the speed of return of lost letters was correlated with clean-up time of trash.


As a pilot, in selected tracts, 24 pieces of litter were dropped in the same locations as lost letters and then checked three times over the course of a day.


Neither timing nor a binary measure of clean-up were found to be associated with either lost letter returns or overall collective efficacy.
